These organic, sculptural forms, created by AI, reflect creative exploration and push the boundaries of ceramic design.",

        "For the Communi-tee 2 competition, CaminoTV asked you to reinvent the iconic Adidas firebird by representing a place that you love, where you feel at home, and you should recognise the firebird model at first glance. For my entry, I imagined a place where you grow and rise, without restriction, symbolised by this phrase: ‘Home is where we rise’. This phrase evokes a place where you can be yourself, where you can become the best version of yourself. It's a reflection of a home that doesn't depend on a specific place, but on a state of mind. Like the Adidas brand, this jacket is an invitation to challenge yourself, to develop yourself. ‘Home’ evokes more than just a place, it's an environment where you can blossom and grow. My typography is based on handwritten letters similar to graffiti. This phrase sounds like a call to self-fulfilment. The word ‘RISE’ was built around the Adidas logo to draw a connection between this jacket and the brand."
